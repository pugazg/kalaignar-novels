# Assembled Tamil Reading Layer — வெள்ளிக்கிழமை

This `sections/` layer is a source-faithful reading layer derived only from audited canonical `../pages/` records. Canonical `pages/` remain authoritative if any conflict appears.

## Assembly structure

The source has **23 chapters**. Mixed boundary scans are split at the source-printed centered chapter heading; a whole physical scan is never mechanically assigned to one chapter.

| File | Source coverage | Chapter | Status |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `01-chapter-01.md` | scans 4–12 | 1 | **VERIFIED** |
| `02-chapter-02.md` | scans 13–22 | 2 | **VERIFIED** |
| `03-chapter-03.md` | scan 23 → scan 33 before centered `4` | 3 | **VERIFIED** |
| `04-chapter-04.md` | scan 33 after centered `4` → scan 45 before centered `5` | 4 | **VERIFIED** |

| `12-chapter-12.md` | scan 99 after centered `12` → scan 107 before centered `13` | 12 | **VERIFIED** |
| `13-chapter-13.md` | scan 107 after centered `13` → scan 115 before centered `14` | 13 | **VERIFIED** |
| `14-chapter-14.md` | scan 115 after centered `14` → scan 120 before centered `15` | 14 | **VERIFIED** |
| `15-chapter-15.md` | scan 120 after centered `15` → scan 127 before centered `16` | 15 | **VERIFIED** |

| `19-chapter-19.md` | scan 149 after centered `19` → scan 154 before centered `20` | 19 | **VERIFIED** |
| `20-chapter-20.md` | scan 154 after centered `20` → scan 160 before centered `21` | 20 | next |
| `21-chapter-21.md` | scan 160 after centered `21` → scan 166 before centered `22` | 21 | pending |
| `22-chapter-22.md` | scan 166 after centered `22` → scan 172 before centered `23` | 22 | pending |

## Assembly rules

1. Derive prose only from verified canonical `pages/` records.
2. Preserve source spelling, punctuation, dialogue, historical forms, colloquial forms and intentional oddities.
3. Exclude audit notes, printer/signature marks, illustrations and later handwriting from reading prose.
4. Keep reversible source provenance with HTML comments.
5. Join only already-verified page-boundary continuities; never invent missing text from grammar.
6. Split mixed boundary scans only at the source-printed centered chapter heading.
7. Canonical `pages/` remain controlling authority and are never changed merely to smooth reading flow.
8. Default workflow is one chapter per iteration; a larger contiguous batch is allowed only on explicit user authorization. Chapters 5–9 and 10–19 were explicit user-authorized batches.
9. Do not mark this layer `PASSED` until all 23 chapters and the final coverage / boundary / continuity / canonical-authority audit pass.

## Chapters 10–19 batch verification

At the user's explicit direction, Chapters **10–19** were assembled and independently verified together from the audited canonical records. No canonical `pages/` file changed.

Mixed chapter-boundary scans were split at centered headings on scans **92 (`11`)**, **99 (`12`)**, **107 (`13`)**, **115 (`14`)**, **120 (`15`)**, **134 (`17`)**, **142 (`18`)**, **149 (`19`)**, and **154 (`20`)**. Chapter 16 begins cleanly at centered `16` on scan 127.

Important source-preservation decisions remain reversible in the section files, including the literal scan 117/118 discontinuity (`உட்` followed by `எவ்வளவோ...`) with no invented completion; scan 122/123 literal `...அவளுக்குப் பக்கத்திலே` → `கார்ந்து கொண்டாள்.` with no grammatical repair; and all verified cross-page word fragments such as `வாழ்` + `விலே`, `அழகப்ப` + `னுடைய`, `பின்னிக்` + `கொண்டன`, `தேவ` + `லோகத்தில்`, and `சந்திப்` + `பதற்காக!`.

Printer/signature marks remain excluded from reading prose, including scan 130 bottom `9`, scan 146 bottom `10`, and earlier recorded non-body marks.

## Current status

**Assembly: IN PROGRESS — 19 / 23 chapters VERIFIED.**

Next: **Chapter 20 — scan 154 after centered `20` through scan 160 before centered `21`**. English remains blocked until the complete assembled Tamil layer passes its final consistency gate.
