# Split-PDF part-completion workflow — புதையல்

The split PDFs are **access derivatives of one source edition**, not separate bibliographic works. A split may reach `part-complete`, but whole-work Tamil/English/release gates remain blocked until the complete edition is processed.

## Per-split sequence

1. map represented source scans;
2. create/reconcile canonical `pages/` records;
3. perform native visual/textual fidelity review;
4. resolve or explicitly retain every `needs-review` item;
5. run a part-level Tamil audit;
6. update assembled Tamil from audited canonical pages only;
7. translate the audited material;
8. source-check English against canonical Tamil;
9. run part-level bilingual review;
10. synchronize status before moving to the next split.

A derivative boundary is provenance only. Do not invent word, sentence, paragraph, scene or chapter boundaries from it.

## Mandatory old-Tamil-typeform check before a correction

This edition contains old/faint Tamil typeforms whose vowel marks can be easy to miss at ordinary zoom. Demonstrated risks now include:

- final `லை`, especially in `இல்லை` / `வில்லை`-type forms, where faint `ை` can make the cluster look like bare `ல்`;
- faint `ா` after a consonant cluster, demonstrated on scan 264 where source `என்னா` was initially misread as `என்ன`.

**The safeguard therefore applies to every Tamil vowel sign and combining mark, not only `ை`.**

Before changing a user baseline because a final letter, vowel sign or combining mark appears absent:

1. enlarge the **whole glyph cluster** at high resolution;
2. inspect the character at more than one useful scale/contrast when the mark is faint;
3. explicitly consider old Tamil typeforms before declaring a discrepancy;
4. compare the same typeform elsewhere in this source edition when useful;
5. require **positive native-pixel evidence** for the replacement;
6. if pixels remain ambiguous, retain the baseline and `needs-review` rather than guessing;
7. never run a global spelling expansion/contraction or vowel-sign replacement — individual source pixels govern every occurrence.

**Strengthened after the scans-256–259 and scan-264 corrections:** if a proposed difference from the baseline involves only an old/faint vowel sign, a near-identical same-word glyph, or apparent word spacing created by a printed line wrap, perform a **second independent high-resolution inspection** before accepting the change. Compare another clear occurrence from the same edition when possible. A printed line break by itself never proves word-internal spacing. If the user/source challenges one glyph in a batch, reopen every assistant-origin discrepancy in that batch before continuing forward.

## Completed split checkpoints

- Part 001 — scans **1–49** — **`part-complete`**
- Part 002 — scans **50–98** — **`part-complete`**
- Part 003 — scans **99–147** — **`part-complete`**
- Part 004 — scans **148–196** — **`part-complete`**
- Part 005 — scans **197–245** — **`part-complete` with explicit source-damage qualification**

## Active split — Part 006

Source derivative: `TVA_BOK_0064097_புதையல்_part_006_pages_246-294.pdf`

- physical pages / mapped source scans: **49 / 49 — scans 246–294**
- visible printed pages: **242–290**
- derivative map: [`indexes/part-006-page-map.md`](indexes/part-006-page-map.md)
- canonical records: **21 / 49 — scans 246–266**
- verified: **21**
- needs-review: **0**
- not-started: **28 — scans 267–294**
- latest native-fidelity record: [`notes/visual-fidelity-scan-266.md`](notes/visual-fidelity-scan-266.md)
- Tamil audit: **not eligible**
- assembled Tamil: **not eligible**
- controlled English: **not eligible**
- bilingual review: **not eligible**
- state: **`in-progress`**

### Current Part-006 checkpoint

- scans 256–259 remain corrected after second high-resolution reinspection;
- scan 260 verifies the Iteration-25 opening and ends `வெள்ளியம்பலம்`;
- scan 261 closes `வெள்ளியம்பலம் கேட்டு விட்டு, ...` and ends `விடிந்த`;
- scan 262 begins `தும்`, yielding `விடிந்ததும்`, closes chapter 29 and begins chapter 30, and ends `துக்காராமுக்கோ,`;
- scan 263 establishes `நடந்தவைகள்`, `புதையலைக் கண்டுபிடிப்பதற்காகவே`, and full `மறந்து விடவில்லை`;
- scan 264 confirms user-corrected source `என்னா`; the earlier assistant `என்ன` is withdrawn;
- scan 265 is verified with full old-type vowel-sign checks and ends `என்றெல்லாம்!`;
- scan 266 is verified with the user baseline wording substantively confirmed; second-pass source checks confirm `வெள்ளியம்பலத்திற்கு`, complete `புரியவில்லை`, both `இஷ்டமில்லை`, `பிரமாதமில்லை`, `ஒன்றுமில்லை`, and `புதையலை` with final `ை`; page ends mid-sentence at `அதில், என்`.

Part-006 mapped chapter transitions: chapter 28 begins scan 247; a four-star internal transition occurs on scan 251; chapter 29 begins 254 and closes 262; chapter 30 begins 262; 31 begins 271; 32 begins 278; 33 begins 288.

Do not run the Part-006 Tamil audit or any downstream stage until all scans 246–294 have canonical records and native-fidelity dispositions.

## Part 005 — durable completion record

- split pages / canonical records: **49 / 49 — scans 197–245**
- `verified`: **42**
- `needs-review`: **7 — scans 215–219, 223–224**
- state: **`part-complete` with source-damage qualification**

## Exact next activity

Reconcile **scan 267 / printed page 263** directly against the native Part-006 source, first continuing scan 266's physical endpoint `அதில், என்`. Apply the strengthened two-pass old-typeform rule to **all vowel signs**, not only final `ை`, before accepting any disputed glyph or word spacing.
