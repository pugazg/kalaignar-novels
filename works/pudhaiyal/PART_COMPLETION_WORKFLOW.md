# Split-PDF part-completion workflow — புதையல்

The split PDFs are **access derivatives of one source edition**, not separate bibliographic works. A split may reach `part-complete`, but whole-work Tamil/English/release gates remain blocked until the complete edition is processed.

## Per-split sequence

1. map represented source scans;
2. create/reconcile canonical `pages/` records;
3. perform native visual/structural fidelity review;
4. resolve or explicitly retain every `needs-review` item;
5. run a part-level Tamil audit;
6. update assembled Tamil from audited canonical pages only;
7. translate the audited material;
8. source-check English against canonical Tamil;
9. run part-level bilingual review;
10. synchronize status before moving to the next split.

A derivative boundary is provenance only. Do not invent word, sentence, paragraph, scene or chapter boundaries from it.

## Pudhaiyal lexical baseline rule — effective from scan 280 onward

By explicit user instruction, scan **280 onward** uses a hybrid authority model.

### WORDS

The user-supplied Gemini transcription controls lexical wording.

- retain supplied words, spelling, suffixes, vowel signs, sandhi, lexical forms and supplied lexical spacing;
- do not replace a supplied word merely because the scan appears to contain a different lexical form;
- if the supplied baseline omitted a word/span altogether, flag the omission instead of silently supplying lexical text from the scan.

For active Part 007, uploaded `p7.md` is the complete lexical baseline.

### STRUCTURE / PRESENTATION

The native scan controls headings/chapter numbers, paragraph boundaries, punctuation, quotation marks, long dashes, speaker-label spacing/layout, physical line/page breaks, separators and chapter/scene transitions.

When a lexical word is split physically across a source line or source page, keep the supplied lexical wording while preserving/recording the native physical split.

## Completed split checkpoints

- Part 001 — scans **1–49** — **`part-complete`**
- Part 002 — scans **50–98** — **`part-complete`**
- Part 003 — scans **99–147** — **`part-complete`**
- Part 004 — scans **148–196** — **`part-complete`**
- Part 005 — scans **197–245** — **`part-complete` with explicit source-damage qualification**
- Part 006 — scans **246–294** — **`part-complete`**

### Verified continuity through scan 312

Part 006 ends at scan 294 with open `‘லாக்`. Part-007 scan 295 begins `அப்’பில்`, establishing **`‘லாக் அப்’பில்`** across the derivative boundary.

Key structural progression:

- scan 297 — chapter 33 closes / chapter 34 begins under source heading `34`;
- scan 302→303 — physical `பெற்` + `றான்` establishes `பெற்றான்`;
- scans 304–305 — source-visible complete lexical omissions (`நீ`, `என்ன`) remain `needs-review` without source insertion;
- scan 306 — chapter 34 closes with a source horizontal rule;
- scan 307 — chapter 35 begins under source heading `35`;
- scan 307→308 — `‘மிருகம்’` → `பதுங்கி விட்டது.`;
- scan 308→309 — `வாழ்க்கைக்` → `காவியத்தை...`;
- scan 309→310 — `...படாமல் இந்த` → `ஊரை விட்டு...`;
- scan 310 — source-printed four-star internal transition; physical ending `போவ`;
- scan 311 — begins `தென்று`, completing `போவதென்று`; ends `பேசிக் கொண்டிருந்து`;
- scan 312 — begins `விட்டு,`; no new complete lexical omission found on scans 308–312.

The endpoint spot-check at scan 343 / printed 339 ends at `அதிர்ஷ்`, so Part 007 also remains open and cannot be treated as the work ending.

## Gate consequence

Sequential canonical work may continue despite scans 304–305 being `needs-review`, but the Part-007 Tamil audit cannot pass until those two complete baseline lexical omissions receive explicit user/baseline disposition.

## Exact next activity

Process **scan 313 / printed 309** in chapter 35 from the controlling `p7.md` lexical baseline and native Part-007 page 19, then continue sequential canonical/structural reconciliation through scan 343.
